Configuration
=============

Most common options of the plugin are following:

#. Use ODL to manage L3 traffic -- this options configures OpenvSwitch for
   managing L3 traffic on compute nodes. If you want to enable this setting,
   first you need to assign public network to all nodes
   (on :guilabel:`Networks`/`Other` pane check :guilabel:`Assign public network
   to all nodes`)

#. Use SFC features

#. BGPVPN extensions

#. Use V2 ML driver

#. OpenDaylight package version -- plugin might be built with multiple versions
   of OpenDaylight. In this text field you enter version that will be
   installed.
